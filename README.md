# Rosalind

[Rosalind Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin) was a British biophysicist whose discovery of DNA's structure transformed science. In a similar way, app bundles built with Xcode have their own hidden structures that, when understood, can significantly improve their performance and efficiency. Our tool, Rosalind, analyzes these app bundles, offering developers clear insights to optimize their work. Like Franklin's legacy of open discovery, we are making Rosalind open-source, ensuring that this knowledge is accessible to everyone, fostering a collaborative and innovative community.
understanding the structure of built products generated by Apple tools can lead to better and more lightweight apps. Unlike DNA,
