# Why Rosalind?

Understanding and optimizing applications requires standardized, detailed reports that reveal an application's internal architecture. Recognizing this universal challenge across development teams, we've open-sourced Rosalind under the MIT license to make this sophisticated analysis accessible to everyone.

`Rosalind` is actively maintained by our dedicated team, ensuring it stays current with evolving development practices and toolchains across the mobile ecosystem.

## Schema

Unlocking a layer of solutions that can help improve the quality and efficiency of mobile applications requires a **standard and open schema** that releases changes in a backward-compatible way. This standardization gives teams and organizations the freedom to migrate between tools with minimal effort and disruption.

Rosalind's [schema](/api/schema) follows these principles and is fully documented, providing a foundation for building powerful tools and workflows to analyze and optimize applications.

Whether you're working in a small team or a large organization, Rosalind's schema provides the flexibility and reliability needed to understand the deep structure of your applications.
