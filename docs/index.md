# Why Rosalind?

Improving the size of a bundle generated by an Xcode project requires diving into the bundle and understanding what is taking up the space. Since this is a common need across many organizations, we open-sourced Rosalind under MIT to make solving this problem easier and accessible to everyone.

`Rosalind` powers some Tuist features and is actively maintained by the Tuist team.

> [!TIP] TUIST ANALYZE
> If you don't plan to wrap Rosalind in your own tool, you can use the command `tuist analyze size` to get a summary of the size of your bundles. The tool works with Xcode and Tuist projects.
