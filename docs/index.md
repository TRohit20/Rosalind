# Why Apple Bundle Analyzer?

Improving the size of a bundle generated by an Xcode project requires diving into the bundle and understanding what is taking up the space. Since this is a common need across many organizations, we open-sourced Apple Bundle Analyzer under MIT to make solving this problem easier and accessible to everyone.

`AppleBundleAnalyzer` powers some Tuist features and is actively maintained by the Tuist team.
